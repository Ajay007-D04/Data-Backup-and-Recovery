Data Backup and Recovery System Using AWS S3 and AWS Backup

This repository contains scripts, configuration files, and instructions to implement a data backup and recovery solution using AWS S3 and AWS Backup. The solution is designed to ensure secure, reliable, and automated backups for critical data in the AWS cloud.

 Features

Secure Data Backup: Use Amazon S3 for storing backup data with encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
Automated Backups: Leverage AWS Backup to automate backup scheduling and lifecycle management.
Recovery Options: Restore data from S3 or through AWS Backup as per recovery requirements.
Tag-Based Backup Policies: Use resource tagging to define backup plans and policies.
Versioning and Lifecycle Management: Maintain data versions and automatically archive or delete old backups.


 Architecture

This solution is based on the following architecture:

1. Data is backed up to an S3 bucket with versioning and encryption enabled.
2. AWS Backup schedules and manages backups of resources (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB, EFS).
3. Lifecycle rules are configured to archive or delete backups based on retention policies.

Setup and Configuration

Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket for Backup

1. Go to the [S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Create a bucket with the following settings:
   - Enable versioning.
   - Enable server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
3. Configure lifecycle rules for archiving or deleting old data.

 Step 2: Configure AWS Backup

1. Go to the [AWS Backup Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/backup/).
2. Create a backup plan:
   - Define backup frequency and retention period.
   - Assign IAM roles for access control.
3. Assign resources to the backup plan using tags or ARNs.

Step 3: IAM Role and Permissions

- Ensure an IAM role with necessary permissions is created and attached to resources.




Restore Data from S3

Restore files from S3 using the following command:
```bash
aws s3 cp s3://your-bucket-name/backup/ /path/to/restore/location --recursive
```

Manage Backups via AWS Backup

Use the AWS Backup console or CLI to:
- List backups.
- Restore resources.
- Update or delete backup plans.



Automation

- Use provided Python scripts or AWS CLI commands for automated backup and restore tasks.
- Set up a cron job or AWS Lambda function for periodic backups.


Security Best Practices

1. Encrypt Data: Use server-side encryption for S3 and AWS Backup.
2. Restrict Permissions: Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and policies.
3. Enable MFA: Use MFA for critical actions in the AWS Management Console.
